### Authors: Edward Yan, Anton Clayton

### Description:
The question we want to answer during this project is whether a machine learning model has an easier time classifying images if they are distinct from each other, or if the model would have similar success on similar images. We will train one model to recognize different butterfly species and one model to recognize different animals. Our initial hypothesis is that the model trained to recognize different animals would be much more successful, as there would be less overlap between the shape and coloration of the animals and environment. This is how we, as humans, see this problem of pattern recognition. However, as we have seen in class, a red crab can look very similar to a light blue squid to a machine.
