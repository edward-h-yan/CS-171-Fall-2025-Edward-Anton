### By Edward Yan (SJSU ID: 016475290)

___

### Question to answer:
- "Which is harder for AI: classifying different animals or distinguishing butterfly species?"

### Our hypothesis:
- The animal model will outperform due to the distinct shapes and colors of the classes.

___

### Installation Instructions:
- No packages / modules need to be installed.
- Keep both of the checkpoint and training history files in the same folder as the notebook.
- After downloading the dataset from Kaggle, keep the training folder and csv file in the same folder as the notebook.

### If I were to continue this project!
If I were to continue this project, I would run more epochs on my current model to see if I can get it to converge and become more accurate. However, the current graphs of the model show signs that the model may already be overfit, so I may first need to make alterations to the model itself. Additionally, I may have to find a more efficient training method or model, as 1000 epochs took almost 7 hours to run. Finally, something cool I could do as a continutation would be doing a deeper analysis of which butterflies tend to get misclassified and why.

#### In my notebook, I feel that I found a good answer to our question we wanted to answer through my own dataset. The amount of effort and training the model had to undergo just to reach 50% accuracy is astonishing compared to how easy Anton was able to get better results on his animal dataset.
